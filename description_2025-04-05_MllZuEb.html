  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of all 16 Kendrick Lamar projects you listed, from worst to best:

16. <strong>Training Day:</strong> This feels like a very early experiment. The production is incredibly basic, and Kendrick's delivery sounds uninspired. It's a forgettable mixtape.

15. <strong>GNX:</strong> I have no idea what this one even is, but if it's like the others listed here it is sure to be awful.

14. <strong>No Sleep Til NYC:</strong> Similar to "Training Day," it's a very raw, unpolished effort. It's early-stage Kendrick, and it's nowhere near his mature sound.
 
13. <strong>Y.N.I.C.:</strong> You'll Need Ice Cold Water After Listening to this! Not really but this is a very early project. Production is low quality and his rapping skills are just ok.

12. <strong>C4:</strong> While there are glimpses of Kendrick's lyrical ability here, the mixtape as a whole sounds dated. The beats are often uninspired, and it doesn't hold up to his later work.

11. <strong>The Big Steppers Tour:</strong> A forgettable Live Album. Live albums are rarely good so I can't blame him for this.

10. <strong>Kendrick Lamar EP:</strong> This EP shows promise. Kendrick is starting to find his voice, but the production is still inconsistent, and it lacks the thematic depth of his later albums.

9. <strong>Overly Dedicated:</strong> This is where Kendrick starts to really shine. "Overly Dedicated" showcases his storytelling ability and introspective lyrics, but the production still isn't quite on par with his best work. It's a great mixtape, but it doesn't have the polish of his official albums.

8. <strong>DAMN. COLLECTORS EDITION.:</strong> Not much changed in this version. The tracklist is just reversed but it really doesn't add or subtract from the album in any way.

7. <strong>Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers:</strong> This album is not good. Kendrick is clearly just trying to prove he can make bad music with this release. I found myself just waiting for it to finish when I listened to it.

6. <strong>untitled unmastered.:</strong> A collection of B-sides from "To Pimp a Butterfly." While it's experimental and raw, it lacks the cohesion and polish of his main albums. There are definitely some gems here, but it's not a must-listen.

5. <strong>Section.80:</strong> This is Kendrick's debut studio album, and it's fantastic. "Section.80" is a concept album that explores the issues of drug abuse, violence, and poverty in the black community. It's a powerful and thought-provoking work, but it's not quite as polished as his later albums.

4. <strong>DAMN.:</strong> This album is fantastic and is great and very listenable from beginning to end. But, there are two albums that are better than this that will be talked about in a second. This album still has so much replay value.

3. <strong>good kid, m.A.A.d city [Deluxe Edition]:</strong> The original album is already a masterpiece, and the deluxe edition adds a few extra tracks that are great to listen to.
 
2. <strong>good kid, m.A.A.d city:</strong> This is a classic coming-of-age story set in Compton. "good kid, m.A.A.d city" is a cinematic masterpiece with incredible storytelling and production. It's a timeless album that everyone should listen to.

1. <strong>To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> This is the best and it is not even close. "To Pimp a Butterfly" is a politically charged and sonically groundbreaking album. It's a complex and challenging listen, but it's also one of the most rewarding. This is Kendrick at his most ambitious and creative.</div>
