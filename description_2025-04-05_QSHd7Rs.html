  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of all 15 Travis Scott albums from worst to best:

1.  <strong>Baby Shark: Rap Remixes Gangsta Thug by Travis Scott (Soundtrack):</strong> This is a pathetic cash-grab and an insult to everything music stands for. The only thing lower than the artistic integrity is the quality.

2.  <strong>JACKBOYS 2:</strong> An obvious attempt at a cash grab that lacks any real substance. Nothing but throwaways.

3.  <strong>Cruis'n USA:</strong> A mess from start to finish. Travis's talent is utterly wasted here.

4.  <strong>JACKBOYS:</strong> Derivative and forgettable. Barely qualifies as an album.

5.  <strong>The Graduates:</strong> Amateurish and uninspired.

6.  <strong>Buddy Rich:</strong> Unoriginal and boring.

7.  <strong>B.A.P.E.:</strong> An absolute snoozefest.

8.  <strong>The Classmates:</strong> Lacks any real personality.

9.  <strong>Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho:</strong> Migos and Travis Scott? A huge disappointment. A waste of potential.

10. <strong>Owl Pharaoh:</strong> Has some interesting ideas, but the execution is lacking. Sounds unfinished.

11. <strong>Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight:</strong> Overhyped and inconsistent. Some bangers, but also a lot of filler.

12. <strong>Days Before Rodeo:</strong> Shows promise, but still rough around the edges.

13. <strong>UTOPIA:</strong> Some highs, but ultimately uneven. Disappointing after the hype.

14. <strong>Rodeo:</strong> Groundbreaking at the time, but hasn't aged well. Still a classic, but overrated.

15. <strong>ASTROWORLD:</strong> Travis at his peak. A masterpiece of production and atmosphere. A defining album of its era.</div>
