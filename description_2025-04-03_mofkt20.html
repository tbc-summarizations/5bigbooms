  <h1>Description for 2025-04-03_00-52-24.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's the rundown of this "Vape Simulator" game.

<strong>Dialog and Text:</strong>

•   <strong>Opening Scene:</strong> "Man, I haven't vaped in a few hours... I'm gonna go vape."
•   <strong>Encounter with the Principal:</strong>
•   Player: "Ayo..."
•   Player: "What was that..."
•   <strong>Law path</strong>

•   Player: "Hey!"
•   Principal: "ok."
•   Text: "You remember that you have a book about law with you"
•   Principal: "What are you reading?"
•   Player: "Sir, you do not have a search warrant."
•   Principal: "Bruh..."
•   <strong>Endings:</strong>
•   <strong>Overdose Ending:</strong> "You vaped too much and passed out"
•   <strong>Good Ending:</strong> "You managed to run away from the principal. You got caught, so there will be future issues..."
•   <strong>Caught Ending:</strong> "You ran too slow and the principal managed to press the emergency button"
•   <strong>Nerd Ending:</strong> "You were smart and knew that it was illegal for the principal to view your pockets without a proper reason"

<strong>Pathways (with brutally honest commentary):</strong>

1.  <strong>The "Overdose" Route (Vape):</strong> Just keep vaping until you keel over.
2.  <strong>The "Avoidance" Route (Run away):</strong> Spam click to attempt to outrun the principal. Depending on click speed, you either get away or get caught because you're too slow and the principal presses the emergency button.
3.  <strong>The "Hall" Route (Go through the hall):</strong> Spam click and run into the principal, end up trapped and get caught, then the principal presses the emergency button.
4.  <strong>The "Nerd" Route (Law):</strong> Show a book to the principal, get the nerd ending because the principal knows it is illegal for him to search pockets.</div>
