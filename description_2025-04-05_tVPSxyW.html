  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Henrythekazakh is definitely in the wrong. His language is completely out of line, bordering on violent and discriminatory. There's no justification for such hateful slurs. Adam's response, while not exactly polite, seems to be a reaction to Henry's initial comment. But the fact that Henry uses that racial slur so many times is pretty offputting. Adam is definitely in the right as he is just chilling and Henry is just being extremely rude and out of order and probably racist.</div>
