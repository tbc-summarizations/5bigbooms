  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because I'm about to deliver some brutally honest opinions on these European national football team logos. No sugarcoating here, just raw assessment.

<strong>Spain: 6/10</strong>

Okay, Spain, you're trying to be regal with all the heraldry, but it comes off as cluttered and dated. The crown, the castle, the lion – it's like you raided a medieval history textbook and slapped it on a shield. The "PLVS VLTRA" banner is pretentious. The only redeeming quality is the star for their World Cup win, but overall, it looks like a royal crest, not a football logo. It needs a serious modern update to actually mean something to the modern fan.

<strong>France: 9/10</strong>

Now we're talking! The French logo is sleek, sophisticated, and undeniably stylish. The rooster is a classic symbol of France, and the minimalist design makes it instantly recognizable. The two stars above are a great reminder of their World Cup triumphs, and the overall color scheme is elegant. It's a symbol of pride and tradition but with a modern twist. <em>Très bien!</em>

<strong>England: 4/10</strong>

Oh, England, where do I even begin? Three lions? Seriously? It's boring, unimaginative, and reeks of outdated tradition. The roses are just...there. It's like they designed this logo in the 12th century and never bothered to update it. Plus, the lions look constipated. It's a symbol of mediocrity and unfulfilled potential. Wake me up when you finally win something significant. Then maybe you can upgrade this snooze-fest.

<strong>Netherlands: 8/10</strong>

The Dutch logo is bold, fierce, and striking. The single lion is powerful and confident, and the bright orange color makes it instantly recognizable. It exudes a sense of national pride and determination. It's simple, yet effective, and perfectly represents the Oranje's attacking style of play. I can't say anything bad about this one.

<strong>Portugal: 7/10</strong>

The cross looks very interesting. Also the shield is very nice but not good enough to be better than France's one. Overall, this one is good and stands for their history but it needs some more modern touch to be better.

<strong>Belgium: 6/10</strong>

Belgium's logo looks like they just put 3 stripes, added some details and said "yeah this is good to go". Also their logo is not showing off anything cool about Belgium, but maybe their flag colors is cool to them I guess?

<strong>Italy: 8/10</strong>

Italy logo is simple but good. Showing off their flag colors, their name, the stars up top for their world cups, it is perfect.

<strong>Germany: 7/10</strong>

Germany's logo is okay, but the Eagle has too much detail and it can be better. Also the color choice is a little bit too monotone for me, I would like to see some more color on this logo.

<strong>Croatia: 9/10</strong>

Croatia's logo is very iconic with their unique checker design that no other country has. It has a very beautiful feel to it, but if they update it more it might get even better, but if they don't update it, it is still good as is.

<strong>Switzerland: 2/10</strong>

What is this even supposed to be?? I don't even know what I'm looking at.

There you have it – a brutally honest assessment of these European national team logos. Some are great, some are awful, and some are just plain forgettable. Hopefully, this provides you with the raw, unfiltered opinion you were looking for.</div>
