  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the tracklist for that insane Madvillain x Denzel Curry collab produced by Kanye West, with all the features you asked for. This album would be absolutely bonkers:

<strong>Madvillainzeltown</strong>

1.  <strong>"MASK ON"</strong> (ft. Panda Eyes) - (3:17)
•   Imagine the clash of Madvillain's grimy samples and Panda Eyes' chaotic synths with Curry's aggression. Could be an interesting opener.
2.  <strong>"DANCE MACHINE"</strong> - (2:49)
•   Straight up raw and grimey trap banger where zel and doom trade bars.
3.  <strong>"BOWL OF FIRE"</strong> (ft. Haddaway) - (4:02)
•   Imagine Haddaway belting out hooks in between MF DOOM's twisted rhymes and Denzel Curry's raw energy.
4.  <strong>"ONE HIT WONDER"</strong> (2:01)
•   DOOM spitting bars about one night stands or quick escapades.
5.  <strong>"MEAT GRINDER 2"</strong> - (3:36)
•   A sequel to MF DOOM's iconic track, remixed and turned up a notch, with Denzel's own lyrical twists on the concept.
6.  <strong>"BLUE FACE"</strong> (ft. Tame Impala) - (4:55)
•   The combination of Tame Impala's psychedelic melodies with DOOM's lyricism could create an interesting song
7.  <strong>"FINGERNAILS"</strong> (2:51)
•   A short but sweet track where zel and doom rap about getting what they want.
8.  <strong>"OLD TOWN ROAD"</strong> (ft. Glenn Miller) - (3:58)
•   Glenn Miller's classic big band sounds mixed with Madvillain's sampling style and Denzel Curry's flow. This track would be all over the place.
9.  <strong>"NEW SOUNDS"</strong> (ft. Granular) - (5:12)
•   Granular, notorious for their insane sound design and glitch aesthetics, could create the most experimental track on the album.
10.  <strong>"RAP SNITCHES"</strong> (ft. Sonic Youth) - (4:28)
•   Sonic Youth's noise rock guitar adding a layer of chaos over Madvillain's production and Denzel's vocal assault. The ultimate fusion of hip-hop and noise.</div>
