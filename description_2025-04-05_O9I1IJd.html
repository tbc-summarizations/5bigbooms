  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of all Drake albums, mixtapes, and EPs, from worst to best:

1.  <strong>$ome $exy $ongs 4 U</strong>: This is something I'd never play again. The production is so bad it is as if a child with learning difficulties made this in his mom's basement.
2.  <strong>Room for Improvement</strong>: This is where Drake started, and it shows.
3.  <strong>100 GIGS (EP)</strong>: Utter garbage! A compilation of throwaway tracks and bad ideas.
4.  <strong>For All The Dogs Scary Hours Edition</strong>: If you like dogs barking in the background, listen to this.
5.  <strong>Dark Lane Demo Tapes</strong>: It feels unfinished, and the tracklist is all over the place.
6.  <strong>Honestly, Nevermind</strong>: I actually tried to enjoy this, but it is too difficult.
7.  <strong>For All the Dogs</strong>: Drake is repeating himself and trying out the same flows he always tries. It sounds repetitive.
8.  <strong>Certified Lover Boy</strong>: This album had so much hype, but it failed to deliver. 
9.  <strong>Scary Hours (EP)</strong>: The original Scary Hours was underwhelming.
10. <strong>What a Time to Be Alive</strong>: It feels more like a Future project with Drake features than a true collab.
11. <strong>Views</strong>: A bloated, inconsistent album that tries to be everything and ends up being nothing.
12. <strong>Scorpion</strong>: The "A-side/B-side" structure feels disjointed.
13. <strong>So Far Gone (EP)</strong>: It lacks the charm and raw emotion of the original mixtape.
14. <strong>Scary Hours 2 (EP)</strong>: A slight improvement over the original, but still not essential.
15. <strong>The Best in the World Pack (EP)</strong>: Decent tracks.
16. <strong>Thank Me Later</strong>: It's a bit too polished and lacks the personality of his later work.
17. <strong>More Life</strong>: It's a playlist masquerading as an album, but it's still pretty good.
18. <strong>Comeback Season</strong>: This is where Drake really started to find his voice.
19. <strong>Her Loss</strong>: A solid collaboration with 21 Savage.
20. <strong>If You're Reading This It's Too Late</strong>: It's dark, brooding, and full of energy.
21. <strong>So Far Gone (Mixtape)</strong>: This mixtape is iconic. It's raw, emotional, and full of bangers.
22. <strong>Care Package</strong>: A collection of loose tracks and deep cuts that showcase Drake's versatility.
23. <strong>Take Care</strong>: It's dark, introspective, and full of memorable moments.
24. <strong>Nothing Was the Same</strong>: This is Drake at his most confident and introspective. The production is lush, the lyrics are sharp, and the overall vibe is impeccable.</div>
