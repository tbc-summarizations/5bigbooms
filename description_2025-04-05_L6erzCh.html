  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to dissect these European football logos with the seriousness they deserve. No holding back.

<strong>Malta:</strong> 2/10

This is a lazy rehash of the Maltese cross. Where's the creativity? Where's the passion? It's like they just slapped a tourist souvenir onto a badge and called it a day. It screams "generic" and "uninspired." It conveys absolutely nothing about Maltese football. They need to scrap this and hire a designer with a pulse.

<strong>Faroe Islands:</strong> 5/10

The swirling colors and "FAF" are modern and energetic, but it lacks any real substance. It's too abstract. It could be for anything â€“ a detergent brand, a tech company, or maybe a really aggressive candy. It needs to incorporate something that connects it to the islands, something that reflects their culture or landscape. They need to think deeper than just a fancy swirl.

<strong>Gibraltar:</strong> 7/10

It's a bit basic with the shield shape and the red and white, but it does get the job done. The rock-like shape within the shield subtly alludes to the Rock of Gibraltar. I wish there was a better way for it to stand out though. It's just a shield in front of a rock.

<strong>Liechtenstein:</strong> 4/10

Oh dear, this is a mess. The half-football/half-mountain motif is disjointed and amateurish. It's like they tried to cram too much into one logo, resulting in a visual train wreck. The color scheme is dull, and the overall design lacks any sense of flow or harmony. It looks like it was designed in 20 minutes by someone who has no experience with design. 

<strong>San Marino:</strong> 6/10

While this one is better than Liechtenstein's it still needs some work. The logo is just an abbreviation of San Marino in a way that it looks like a castle. While this is not bad, it still feels very outdated and a new creative logo should be considered.</div>
