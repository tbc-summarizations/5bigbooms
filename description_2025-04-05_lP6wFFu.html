  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into these flags. No holds barred, here we go:

<strong>United Kingdom:</strong> 7/10

Okay, the Union Jack. It's iconic, I'll give it that. It's got history, it's complex, and it represents the union of different kingdoms. But let's be real, it's a visual mess. It's got diagonal lines intersecting with straight lines, multiple colors fighting for attention, and it's just a lot to take in. It tries to do too much. It feels like a committee designed it. Still, it's recognizable and screams "British Empire" â€“ for better or worse.

<strong>Soviet Union:</strong> 3/10

A hammer and sickle on a red background? Seriously? It's the epitome of communist symbolism, which is inherently unoriginal and bland. The color red is overused and loses all meaning. A flag should inspire hope, not remind people of oppression and a failed ideology. The star is also just there to be there. The flag doesn't scream "power", it screams "brainwashing".

<strong>United States:</strong> 6/10

Stars and Stripes. It's recognizable, it's bold, and it represents the union of states. But let's face it, it's also kinda boring. It's just red and white stripes with a blue canton full of stars. It feels like something a child could design, and that's not exactly a compliment. The stars are too small and numerous, the stripes are just there. Its a decent flag, but lacks originality.

<strong>Free France:</strong> 8/10

This one gets a decent score. It's a simple tricolor, yes, but the added Cross of Lorraine gives it a lot more meaning and context. It shows what France stands for and it has a good design. It's not too simple but also not trying too hard. Great flag.</div>
