  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here is a scathing critique of Henry's Object Show as requested. Buckle up, because this is going to be brutal.

<strong>Essay on Henry's Object Show</strong>

Henry's Object Show, or whatever number of it we're on (the host can't even keep track), is a testament to the utter and complete lack of originality that plagues the object show community. The concept? A cast of random, mostly uninspired objects compete in challenges of varying levels of absurdity, leading to eliminations. Sounds familiar? That's because it's the same formula every other object show has been peddling for years, except it's worse.

<strong>The "Challenges"</strong>
The challenges are as predictable as they are tasteless. It's all just a parade of shock value:
•   Killing yourself
•   Hijacking a plane? Like 911? Not funny at all
•   Running from furry people with rainbow flags. Cringe.
•   Making the host birthday gifts.

These challenges are just lame and don't make me care to watch anything at all. It's like the creator just wants to see if they can get away with saying anything online without actually trying to create something entertaining.

<strong>The "Characters"</strong>
Oh, the characters. Where do I even begin?
•   <strong>Triangle Guy(Wami Bosum):</strong> The host is a yellow triangle with an eye – as if this lack of creativity should be praised. The voice acting is awful, with the guy trying way too hard to sound funny.
•   <strong>Dekoder:</strong> This guy says he's from Estonia, but all he does is spew out nonsense and bad takes like the 9/11 takes from his "team".
•   <strong>Pleaseun_banhenry:</strong> This dude is all "hot" with his avatar, and is always acting like the "I don't care" guy.
•   <strong>Airplane:</strong> This character is a straight up 911 joke. This show is insensitive as all hell.
•   <strong>Stickman:</strong> Literally just a stick figure, not that funny.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> This racist character is just there to spew out offensive tropes.
•   <strong>Emoji:</strong> More nothing character!
•   <strong>Meethexep:</strong> What's that a meth cat with a meth addiction?
•   <strong>Neshtek:</strong> Oh yes, our rich pigeon who has a French fried crown and a whole lot of bitches. This is just disgusting and gross.

The rest of the cast is just as forgettable and/or irritating, contributing nothing but filler and cringeworthy dialogue. And they're uninspired and badly drawn.

<strong>Overall Opinion</strong>

Henry's Object Show is a bottom of the barrel. It fails to deliver any originality, humor, or charm, relying instead on cheap shock value and stale memes to try and stay relevant.

<strong>Episode Ranking</strong>

Given how painful it was to watch, ranking the episodes is like choosing which form of torture I prefer. But here's the breakdown:

•   <strong>S6</strong>: If i had to choose it will be the best of a bad buch. it got me this essay so It must be important

<strong>Character Ranking</strong>

All these characters suck, but whatever, here's the breakdown.
• Pleaseun_banhenry - least sucky, so I give to him.

<strong>Elimination Votes</strong>
Here's what I would've done in the eliminations.

S6:

•   Zelensky - who cares about some random pres
•   Agario - this sucks.
•   Stickman - it's too bland, you know?

<strong>Final Verdict</strong>

This show is the bottom of the barrel. Dumpster-fire material. If Henry wants to make a name for himself in the object show community, he needs to seriously rethink his approach and start creating something original and actually funny. Until then, this is just a waste of time.

This is how I truly feel about it, and you told me to keep it honest. I hope this meets your expectations.</div>
