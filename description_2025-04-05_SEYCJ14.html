  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of all 42 MF DOOM albums, from worst to best. No holding back, just my straight-up opinion:

1.  <strong>Expektoration Live:</strong> Live albums are rarely essential, and this one doesn't change that. The energy's there, but the sound quality is meh, and it's a one-time listen.
2.  <strong>Special Herbs &amp; Spices Vol. 1:</strong> Some interesting sounds but it fails to stand out.
3.  <strong>Live from Planet X:</strong> Another live album, and it just doesn't capture the magic of DOOM's studio work. Skip it.
4.  <strong>Special Herbs, Vol. 1:</strong> Instrumental albums usually only appeal to a select audience, and even then, they are rarely that good.
5.  <strong>Take Me to Your Leader:</strong> King Ghidora has a few good songs but is not close to the worst album on the list.
6.  <strong>Four Tet Remixes:</strong> Remixes can be cool, but these don't add much. The original tracks are superior.
7.  <strong>Special Herbs, Vol. 2:</strong> More instrumental beats. Some are decent, but it's mostly background music.
8.  <strong>Special Herbs, Vol. 3:</strong> Still more instrumentals, and this one doesn't offer much in the way of innovation.
9.  <strong>Special Herbs, Vol. 4:</strong> The beats start to blend together. It's hard to distinguish one from another.
10. <strong>Rae Dawn / Change the Beat:</strong> This one is just a single, and not a very memorable one at that.
11. <strong>MM..LeftOvers:</strong> As the title implies, these are leftovers. Some interesting snippets, but mostly forgettable.
12. <strong>Venomous Villain:</strong> The concept is interesting, but the execution falls flat. It's a bit too chaotic and unfocused.
13. <strong>Occult Hymn:</strong> Experimental, but not in a good way. This one is a bit too out there for most listeners.
14. <strong>Special Herbs 7,8:</strong> Some interesting loops, but it's nothing you haven't heard before.
15. <strong>Special Herbs 9+0:</strong> More of the same. Decent instrumentals, but nothing groundbreaking.
16. <strong>Super What?:</strong> Lyrically weak, and the production is uninspired. This is a serious low point in DOOM's discography.
17. <strong>Special Blends 1+2:</strong> Decent beats, but it doesn't stand out from the rest of the "Special Herbs" series.
18. <strong>Czarface Meets Metal Face:</strong> The potential was there, but the collaboration doesn't fully gel. It's decent, but not great.
19. <strong>MUGGS x DOOM:</strong> The production is solid, but DOOM's rhymes feel a bit phoned in.
20. <strong>NehruvianDOOM:</strong> Some good moments, but it's not as strong as other collaborative efforts.
21. <strong>King Ghidra:</strong> This is MF DOOM's persona but a lower point in his discography.
22. <strong>Man's Worst Enemy:</strong> More MF DOOM personas but a lower point in his discography.
23. <strong>Black Bastards:</strong> Controversial name aside, this album has some solid tracks but a lower point in his discography.
24. <strong>MF:</strong> The album is just called MF and only includes instrumentals.
25. <strong>Special Herbs, Vols. 1 &amp; 2:</strong> Some people find the instrumentals relaxing or creative, but they're just not my cup of tea.
26. <strong>Special Herbs, Vols. 3 &amp; 4:</strong> The instrumentals are only getting old.
27.  <strong>Special Herbs, Vols. 5 &amp; 6:</strong> Some better instrumentals on this one.
28.  <strong>Special Herbs, 4,5,6:</strong> It's fine but it would be better if it had DOOM rapping over it.
29. <strong>Madvillainy 2 The Madlib Remix:</strong> An interesting remix, but some of the charm of the original is lost.
30. <strong>Mr. Hood:</strong> A solid start to DOOM's career, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of his later work.
31. <strong>The Prof Meets The Supervillain:</strong> The Prof is a great producer with a distinct sound but there are better MF DOOM albums.
32. <strong>Vaudeville Villain:</strong> This is one of his best and more well-known albums, but not even close to the best of his discography.
33. <strong>Bookhead:</strong> Bookhead is not his best but better than some other albums on this list.
34. <strong>Tick, Tickâ€¦:</strong> Same as bookhead this album is good and should be on all MF DOOM fans' radars but nothing crazy.
35. <strong>MM..FOOD [20th Anniversary Edition]:</strong> A 20th-anniversary edition to an album that is already on this list is going to be ranked a similar way.
36.  <strong>Madvillainy Demos:</strong> Hearing the unpolished demos is fascinating, but the final product is still superior.
37. <strong>Key to the Kuffs:</strong> A good collaboration, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of DOOM's best work.
38. <strong>Operation: Doomsday:</strong> A classic album but not DOOM's best work.
39. <strong>Born Like This:</strong> A creative album from DOOM's later years.
40. <strong>The Mouse and the Mask:</strong> The adult swim collabs are great and this one is no exception.
41. <strong>Madvillainy:</strong> Classic album.
42. <strong>MM..FOOD:</strong> A concept album that is perfect from start to finish.</div>
