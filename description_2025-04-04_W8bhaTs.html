  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of these clubs' new formations based on pure, unadulterated ruthlessness and ability to cause chaos. Prepare for some controversial opinions:

<strong>Ranking of Clubs (Most to Least Ruthless):</strong>

1.  <strong>Chelsea:</strong> This lineup is truly terrifying. Hitler, Saddam, and Satan on the same team? That's a recipe for global domination through fear and oppression. Darth Vader brings strategic genius and a merciless attitude. Derek Chauvin and Jefferson Davis represent institutional cruelty. Pablo Escobar brings unmatched financial resources (albeit ill-gotten). This team has it all: raw power, strategic planning, and a complete lack of moral restraint.

2.  <strong>Arsenal:</strong> This team has a distinct edge in unpredictability and manipulative power. Genghis Khan and Mao bring unmatched ruthless, large-scale power. Joseph Stalin provides iron-fisted control and tactical manipulation. Ted Bundy and Jack the Ripper bring a personal and terrifying touch. Kanye West's ego and disruptive personality make him the ultimate wild card. This team will win by any means necessary.

3.  <strong>Manchester City:</strong> This lineup is a mix of calculated destruction and sheer, unadulterated madness. Thanos and Voldemort bring power on a cosmic and magical scale. Vladimir Putin and Osama Bin Laden provide strategic cunning and global reach. Walter White is the ultimate mastermind with the capability to create anything needed to win. Death and The Joker are the embodiment of chaos, and cannot be stopped from doing what they want.

<strong>My Reasoning:</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea</strong> takes the top spot because of its concentration of pure, unadulterated evil. The combination of Hitler, Saddam, and Satan creates a level of ruthlessness that's hard to beat.
•   <strong>Arsenal</strong> comes in second due to its potent mix of large-scale cruelty, personal terror, and unpredictable chaos.
•   <strong>Manchester City</strong> is a powerful force, but lacks the same level of depravity as the other two.</div>
