  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of all 21 Michael Jackson albums, from worst to best. Buckle up, some of these might sting:

1.  <strong>Farewell My Summer Love:</strong> This is bottom of the barrel. A cash grab of outtakes and remixes. It's clearly unfinished and lacks any real artistic merit. Honestly, it's an insult to his legacy.

2.  <strong>Looking Back to Yesterday:</strong> Another collection of leftovers. Predictable and formulaic. Jackson's vocals are fine, but the material is weak and uninspired.

3.  <strong>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial:</strong> I hate this album with burning passion. It is just him reading off of a movie script.

4.  <strong>Got to Be There:</strong> While not terrible, it's a very basic, generic early 70s Motown sound. He was just a kid, and it shows. Lacks any real personality.

5.  <strong>Ben:</strong> Slightly better than "Got to Be There," but still sounds like a kids' project. The title track is good, but the rest is forgettable.

6.  <strong>Music &amp; Me:</strong> More of the same. Jackson's voice is developing, but the material is still mostly fluff. It's just there.

7.  <strong>Forever, Michael:</strong> He's getting a bit better here. Still very much a kid-friendly sound, but hints of the artist he would become are starting to peek through.

8.  <strong>Michael:</strong> This album is posthumous, and it sounds like it. The production is all over the place, and the authenticity of some tracks is questionable. It's a sad reminder of what could have been.

9.  <strong>Blood on the Dancefloor: HIStory in the Mix:</strong> Some okay remixes and a handful of new tracks that are far from his best. The title track is cool, but the rest is filler.

10. <strong>Thriller 25:</strong> It has too many remixes. The original album is great (as you'll see later), but the remixes are unnecessary and ruin the flow.

11. <strong>This Is It:</strong> This album is a decent compilation of his hits, but the new track "This Is It" is forgettable.

12. <strong>Bad 25:</strong> Slightly better than the original album, some fun extra tracks and live performances.

13. <strong>Immortal:</strong> A Cirque du Soleil soundtrack. It's a cool concept, but it doesn't hold up as a cohesive album. Fun for fans, but not essential.

14. <strong>XSCAPE:</strong> Another posthumous release. It's better than "Michael" because the tracks are more polished, but it still feels incomplete.

15. <strong>Thriller 40:</strong> Better than the original album as it's a complete package.

16. <strong>Invincible:</strong> Overlong and inconsistent. Some great tracks, but weighed down by too much filler. It tried to recapture the "Dangerous" magic, but falls short.

17. <strong>HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I:</strong> Ambitious and sprawling. The "HIStory Begins" disc is fantastic, but the "HIStory Continues" disc is a mixed bag. Still, a bold and important work.

18. <strong>Dangerous:</strong> A huge leap forward. Grittier and more experimental than "Bad." Some of his best singles are on this album.

19. <strong>Bad:</strong> A pop masterpiece. Every track is a banger. Polished, slick, and undeniably catchy.

20. <strong>Off the Wall:</strong> The album that launched him into superstardom. Funky, disco-infused, and full of energy. It's the sound of a young artist finding his voice.

21. <strong>Thriller:</strong> No explanation needed. The perfect pop album. Groundbreaking, iconic, and timeless. Every song is a classic.

There you go. My honest, unfiltered take. Feel free to disagree.</div>
