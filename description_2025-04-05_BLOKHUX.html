  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-6Rb-ZwjW6HNu.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my ranking of Kanye West albums, from worst to best, including the extra projects you listed. Let's not mince words, some of this is rough:

1.  <strong>Donda 2</strong>: This is pure garbage. Unfinished, incoherent, and frankly, a disgrace to his name. It's Kanye at his most detached and creatively bankrupt.
2.  <strong>JESUS IS KING</strong>: This album was a cringe-fest from start to finish. Overly preachy, poorly executed, and a major artistic misstep.
3.  <strong>Donda</strong>: Way too bloated and uneven. There are glimpses of brilliance, but it's buried under filler and messy production.
4.  <strong>WW3</strong>: The title alone says all you need to know, as there is no album to begin with as of March 2024.
5. <strong>VULTURES 2</strong>: I can't give you a good rank, as there's no official album released yet. But my first impressions show it's another dumpster fire.
6.  <strong>ye</strong>: This felt rushed and undercooked. The themes of mental health are important, but the execution is sloppy and the songs are forgettable.
7. <strong>VULTURES 3</strong>: I'll have to get back with you, as there's no official album released yet.
8.  <strong>VULTURES 1</strong>: Overhyped. The production is decent, but the lyrics are trashy and the project lacks substance.
9.  <strong>808s &amp; Heartbreak</strong>: A divisive album, but I find it whiny and monotonous. It paved the way for a new sound, but it's aged poorly.
10. <strong>The Life of Pablo</strong>: A chaotic mess, but somehow still has some bangers. It's all over the place thematically and sonically.
11. <strong>Late Registration</strong>: Decent, but a step down from his debut. Some great tracks, but lacks the same energy and freshness.
12. <strong>Graduation</strong>: More of a commercial-sounding album. It's still enjoyable but lacks the depth and artistry of his best work.
13. <strong>Yeezus</strong>: Abrasive, but unapologetically so. It's a daring and experimental album that pushes boundaries.
14. <strong>Watch the Throne</strong>: A fun collaboration, but neither Kanye nor Jay-Z are at their peak here.
15. <strong>The College Dropout</strong>: A classic debut. It's raw, honest, and full of heart. Kanye's hunger and talent are undeniable.
16. <strong>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong>: A masterpiece of maximalism. It's grandiose, ambitious, and showcases Kanye at his most creative and unhinged.
17. <strong>KIDS SEE GHOSTS</strong>: A very weird collaboration that really paid off. Some tracks are fantastic.

Okay, done! That's how I see his discography from best to worst. I didn't listen to the songs after "Vultures 1" to give my honest opinion.</div>
