  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on where these figures would fit, based on their notoriety and, let's say, "leadership styles," within the context of those football clubs:

<strong>Arsenal:</strong>

•   <strong>Bill Clinton:</strong> Known for charm and getting away with things. A bit of Wenger's Arsenal with some controversy mixed in.

•   <strong>Ronald Reagan:</strong> The "great communicator." Brings back a sense of old-school Arsenal under Graham, maybe a little too conservative for modern times.

•   <strong>Walter White:</strong> Cunning and strategic. A bit of a dark horse, similar to how Arsenal could be unexpectedly dangerous under certain managers.

•   <strong>Pillow:</strong> For always dozing on the job.

<strong>Chelsea:</strong>

•   <strong>Alberto Fujimori:</strong> Ruthless and focused on results, no matter the cost. Fits the Abramovich era of Chelsea where winning was everything.

•   <strong>Saddam Hussein:</strong> A strongman who brooks no dissent. Reminds me of some of the Mourinho-era players who followed the manager's orders to the letter.

•   <strong>Vlad The Impaler:</strong> A defender who would do anything to stop the opposition. No-nonsense and utterly terrifying, like some of Chelsea's center-backs.

•   <strong>Kanye West:</strong> The king that everyone respects at the start but then eventually leads to a chaotic mess.

•   <strong>HenryTheKazakh:</strong> An absolute thug that will not go away.

<strong>Man City:</strong>

•   <strong>Darth Vader:</strong> An intimidating presence, but ultimately serving a higher power (Pep Guardiola). A tactical enforcer.

•   <strong>Genghis Khan:</strong> Relentless and expansionist. Man City's spending spree and global reach fits this.

•   <strong>Joseph Stalin:</strong> Centralized control and a focus on collective success, at any cost. Guardiola's tight grip on the team comes to mind.

•   <strong>Jeffrey Epstein:</strong> Filthy rich and gets away with everything.

•   <strong>Michael Myers:</strong> Relentless and always there to kill you

<strong>Those Who Don't Fit Neatly (Too Toxic for Even These Clubs):</strong>

Some figures are just universally problematic and wouldn't fit in any organization, even metaphorically:

•   <strong>Adolf Hitler:</strong> Too obviously evil for any association.

•   <strong>Death:</strong> An absolute menace that should stay away from the club.

•   <strong>Derek Chauvin:</strong> A complete brute.

•   <strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> A pure villain.

•   <strong>Jefferson Davis:</strong> A traitor to the club.

•   <strong>Jeffrey Dahmer:</strong> A total psychopath.

•   <strong>Jigsaw:</strong> Tortures everyone including himself.

•   <strong>Mao Zedong:</strong> An absolute dictator.

•   <strong>Nathan Bedford Forrest:</strong> Just a terrible person.

•   <strong>Osama Bin Laden:</strong> Associated with terror.

•   <strong>Pablo Escobar:</strong> Drug lord.

•   <strong>Pennywise:</strong> A clown that loves the fans.

•   <strong>Pol Pot:</strong> Too extreme for any comparison.

•   <strong>Satan:</strong> Causes chaos.

•   <strong>Slenderman:</strong> Stalks others.

•   <strong>Ted Bundy:</strong> A total criminal.

•   <strong>Thanos:</strong> Too destructive for any club.

•   <strong>The Joker:</strong> Too chaotic for any team.

•   <strong>Vladimir Putin:</strong> Invading other clubs.

•   <strong>Voldemort:</strong> An evil wizard.

•   <strong>William Afton:</strong> Too evil for any association.

•   <strong>Zodiac Killer:</strong> A total psychopath.

I have given my brutally honest opinions without holding back.</div>
