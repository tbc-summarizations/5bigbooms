  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on Real Madrid's new, um, "unique" squad:

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> This team is an absolute nightmare. Not in a good way, either. They'd be unstoppable on the field, sure, but off the field, it'd be a PR disaster of epic proportions. The ethical implications are so horrifying, that its not even funny. The pure evil of the team is hard to ignore.

<strong>Strengths:</strong>

•   <strong>Unmatched Ruthlessness:</strong> With Satan managing and a team full of villains, there's zero chance of mercy or playing fair. Opponents will be psychologically terrorized before the game even starts.
•   <strong>Defensive Intimidation:</strong> Good luck getting past that backline. Pennywise, Darth Vader, Thanos, and Michael Myers are physically imposing and psychologically damaging. Intimidation alone would win them half their games.
•   <strong>Midfield Control:</strong> Voldemort would use unspeakable spells to disable the opponent.
•   <strong>Goal-Scoring Prowess:</strong> Vlad the Impaler has the killer instinct needed to score goals.

<strong>Weaknesses:</strong>

•   <strong>Team Chemistry:</strong> How do you get a group of sociopathic, self-serving villains to work together? Expect constant infighting, power struggles, and maybe even a few on-field murders.
•   <strong>Discipline:</strong> Good luck getting this team to follow the rules of the game, let alone basic social norms. Red cards galore.
•   <strong>Public Image:</strong> This team would be universally hated. Sponsors would run for the hills, and fans would be protesting outside the stadium every game.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Slenderman (GK):</strong> Can use his height and reach to make impossible saves.
•   <strong>Pennywise (LB):</strong> His agility and the ability to morph into people's fears would be excellent on defense.
•   <strong>Darth Vader (CB):</strong> Intimidation and has the Force, so he would be a good stopper.
•   <strong>Thanos (CB):</strong> Immense strength, near invulnerability, and a tactical mind make him an ideal defender.
•   <strong>Michael Myers (RB):</strong> Relentless and impossible to kill. Opponents would be too scared to go near him.
•   <strong>Voldemort (CDM):</strong> Dark magic gives him an unfair advantage in intercepting passes and disarming opponents.
•   <strong>Walter White (CM):</strong> Strategic mastermind. Also, not afraid to poison the opposing team's water supply.
•   <strong>The Joker (CAM):</strong> Chaotic and unpredictable. Great at creating opportunities, but might just decide to self-destruct the whole team.
•   <strong>William Afton (LW):</strong> His mind-games are sure to work and make others scared of him.
•   <strong>Vlad the Impaler (ST):</strong> Ruthless and efficient finisher.
•   <strong>Jigsaw (RW):</strong> Creates mind games for the other team to play.

<strong>Bench:</strong> A who's who of history's worst people. Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler, and the rest bring a level of pure evil and tactical genius that could turn any game around, or just instigate a global war. Even Pillow and Ronald Reagan are questionable.

<strong>Manager (Satan):</strong> The only one who could possibly control this squad.

<strong>Final Verdict:</strong> This team would likely win every game, but at what cost? They'd be a disgrace to the sport and a symbol of everything that's wrong with humanity. Plus, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near that locker room. They are pure evil, and would bring hell on earth to Real Madrid.</div>
