  <h1>Description for Screenshot_20250404_072337_Instagram.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This squad is absolutely terrifying and brilliantly evil. Here's my brutally honest assessment:

<strong>Strengths:</strong>

•   <strong>Intimidation Factor:</strong> Opponents would be psychologically defeated before even stepping on the pitch. No one in their right mind would want to tackle Darth Vader or go one-on-one with Michael Myers.
•   <strong>Ruthless Defense:</strong> Thanos and Darth Vader are an unbreakable wall. Pennywise is surprisingly fast for a clown, and Michael Myers is unkillable and relentless. Slenderman's sheer presence will unnerve any forward attempting a shot.
•   <strong>Creative Midfield:</strong> Walter White's tactical genius, combined with Voldemort's dark magic and the Joker's unpredictability, makes for a frighteningly potent midfield. Opponents will be bamboozled, poisoned, and cursed simultaneously.
•   <strong>Brutal Attack:</strong> William Afton's cunning and depravity on the left, Vlad the Impaler's pure savagery up front, and Jigsaw's penchant for mind games on the right... defenses will crumble from fear and strategic torment.
•   <strong>Masterful Management:</strong> Who better than Satan himself to lead this hellish team? His leadership will ensure complete dedication and a win-at-all-costs mentality.
•   <strong>Terrifying Bench:</strong> Bringing on Pol Pot, Death, the Zodiac Killer, or even Putin would make them the most feared football team of all time.

<strong>Weaknesses:</strong>

•   <strong>Discipline:</strong> The Joker and Vlad the Impaler are walking red cards. Keeping them under control will be a constant challenge. I think that The Joker will be the problem as Vlad the Impaler does what the manager tells him.
•   <strong>Team Chemistry:</strong> A team of such individualistic villains might struggle to work together cohesively. There would need to be a strict hierarchy enforced by Satan to avoid infighting.
•   <strong>Pace:</strong> Thanos isn't exactly known for his speed, which could be exploited by a team with fast wingers. The defense can't do anything because of this.
•   <strong>Morality:</strong> Even the FIFA board might have a problem with this lineup.

<strong>Overall Rating:</strong>

I'd give this squad a solid <strong>9.5/10</strong>. The sheer horror and dominance are undeniable, but the potential for internal chaos and ethical concerns could be a downfall. Still, I think that they would still win the Champions League.</div>
