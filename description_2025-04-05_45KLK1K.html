  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of all 17 Eminem albums from worst to best, no punches pulled:

1.  <strong>Revival:</strong> An absolute train wreck. Horrendous production, cringeworthy lyrics, and a complete misunderstanding of what made Eminem great. The only good thing about this album is that it made everyone appreciate his other work more.

2.  <strong>Encore:</strong> The beginning of the decline. Bloated, lazy, and filled with childish humor that falls flat. It has a few decent tracks, but overall, it's a disappointment compared to his earlier work.

3.  <strong>Relapse: Refill:</strong> A slight improvement over the original <em>Relapse</em> due to the added tracks, but still weighed down by the overly stylized accents and horrorcore themes that become tiresome.

4.  <strong>Relapse:</strong> Conceptually interesting, but the execution is flawed. The serial killer theme gets old fast, and the accents are distracting. It's technically impressive, but not enjoyable to listen to repeatedly.

5.  <strong>Music to Be Murdered By - Side B:</strong> A mixed bag. Some genuinely great lyrical moments, but also plenty of filler and questionable production choices. It feels like a collection of leftovers rather than a cohesive album.

6.  <strong>Music To Be Murdered By:</strong> Another inconsistent effort. It has some strong tracks and showcases Eminem's lyrical prowess, but it's also plagued by awkward flows and questionable guest features.

7.  <strong>Recovery:</strong> Overproduced and overly sentimental. It has its moments, but it lacks the raw energy and wit of his earlier work. It's a decent pop-rap album, but not a great Eminem album.

8.  <strong>Infinite:</strong> A decent debut, but it sounds like he's trying too hard to emulate other rappers. It's a promising start, but he hadn't yet found his own voice.

9. <strong>Slim Shady EP:</strong> it is a really nice EP as it's not so mainstream and he's not yet at his prime but he does try his best here. This is why I've placed it slightly higher.

10. <strong>Kamikaze:</strong> A fiery and aggressive response to his critics. It's undeniably entertaining, but it lacks the depth and substance of his best work. It's more of a diss track collection than a proper album.

11. <strong>The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr√¢ce):</strong> Okay, this album I am very hyped to hear, and judging by what he's done so far I am more than likely to enjoy.

12. <strong>8 Mile:</strong> Not a proper studio album, but the soundtrack is fantastic. It captures the energy and spirit of the film and features some of Eminem's best work, including "Lose Yourself."

13. <strong>The Marshall Mathers LP2:</strong> A worthy sequel to his classic album. It recaptures some of the energy and aggression of the original while still feeling fresh and modern.

14. <strong>The Slim Shady LP:</strong> The album that launched him into superstardom. It's funny, irreverent, and filled with catchy hooks. It's not his most consistent work, but it's undeniably iconic.

15. <strong>The Eminem Show:</strong> A more mature and introspective effort. It's still filled with his signature humor and aggression, but it also tackles more serious topics like fame and politics.

16. <strong>The Marshall Mathers LP:</strong> Controversial, shocking, and undeniably brilliant. It's a raw and unflinching look at fame, family, and the dark side of the American dream.

17. <strong>Devil's Night:</strong> I have not listened to Devil's Night album but I presume that the amount of sales would be high, which would mean that the songs on that album were enjoyable.</div>
