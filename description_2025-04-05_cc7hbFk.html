  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the roast:

AdamMady, your profile picture looks like a bird got into a toxic waste dump and somehow survived. And your contribution to the chat is just a sad troll face and a declaration of bedtime. Maybe you should stick to counting sheep instead of trying to be edgy.

Berishbaev, you're so obsessed with the word "nigger" that you spam it like a broken record. Do you think that makes you cool or something? It just makes you look like a pathetic loser who can't come up with anything original to say. Seriously, get a life. You're both just sad excuses for human beings.</div>
