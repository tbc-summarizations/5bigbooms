  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to deliver some merciless, yet brutally honest scores and opinions on these football logos.

<strong>1. Belarus (ABFF): 6/10</strong>

This looks like a poorly designed soccer ball with a lion's head poorly photoshopped into the middle of it. It's trying to be modern, but it ends up looking generic and forgettable. And what's with the typography? It's clunky and doesn't match the rest of the logo. Belarus, you need to step up your design game.

<strong>2. Armenia: 7/10</strong>

Okay, now we're talking a bit more. The logo features the mountains of Armenia, which gives it a strong sense of place and identity. The soccer ball is also there but it doesn't overshadow the main meaning of it, however I am not a fan of the font they used, the numbers look clunky and do not fit the logo at all.

<strong>3. Kazakhstan (KFF): 8/10</strong>

This is a solid design. The use of the eagle is powerful and represents the national pride. The circle design and the color palette are well executed. A very unique style and it looks and represents Kazakhstan very well.

<strong>4. Azerbaijan (AFFA): 5/10</strong>

The color pallete is very nice and represents the country itself and the soccer ball has a nice design. However the text below looks very generic and doesn't represent any aspect of the country itself. It is simply there, uninspired.

<strong>5. Estonia: 6/10</strong>

It feels quite simple, but the design is pleasing to the eyes and represents the identity of Estonia as a country. However I think it could be more ambitious, and the typography doesn't work that well.

<strong>6. Cyprus: 4/10</strong>

What is this? It looks like someone asked their kid to draw the Cyprus map, I do not get any meaning of this logo. It seems very simple and amateurish. The map itself is not aesthetically pleasing and overall it looks very plain and forgettable.

<strong>7. Latvia: 7/10</strong>

This has a modern and sleek design. I love the shield shape and the use of the silver color. It gives a sense of dynamism and strength. The font looks very nice and it fits the overall aesthetic of the logo.

<strong>8. Georgia: 7/10</strong>

I don't know what's up with the typography. It looks very poorly done. However I like the design itself, it has a historical meaning behind it and it has a very unique style. But the typography drags it down.

<strong>9. Lithuania: 6/10</strong>

The yellow theme is a bit dull and uninspired but the meaning of the logo is very strong. It has a historical meaning behind it but I think it could be better in terms of design and colors.

<strong>10. Moldova: 8/10</strong>

I love the colors they used for this logo and it has a nice shape. Everything fits together aesthetically. It represents Moldova very well and overall I like it.</div>
