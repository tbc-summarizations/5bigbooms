  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-etZ-3LaXAy1t.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">"Weird Ass Shit" is a truly groundbreaking object show that is both hilarious and thoughtful. One of the show's strongest aspects is its bizarre cast of characters.

<strong>Uami Bosim</strong> is an arrogant prick who thinks he is the star of the channel, as he has to use his Russian-speaking voice to speak. Uami cares way too much about Doritos.

<strong>Dekoder</strong> is the based and sigma mail of the object show community as a person who can't decide between the two teams that is up for elimination and doesn't care which character has been eliminated.

<strong>PLEASEUN_BANHENRY</strong> is the guy that loves to scream a lot and be mean and he is kind of an idiot. His plan involves screaming "Transylvania is Hungary" to the Romanian just to make them cry.

<strong>United Airlines Flight 93</strong> is a plane that hijacks himself to attack people so that they would get a terrible feeling.

<strong>Stickman</strong> is such a fucking idiot. It is a stereotype of all low-quality object show characters.

<strong>Kazakhstan</strong> is a sad guy who loves to act so over-exaggerated that he gets banned by the rest of his team.

<strong>Emoji</strong> is a happy face, but it has such a big face and can barely get through any challenges without any cheating.

<strong>Meethexep</strong> doesn't care about anything as long as he gets to be with his friends, even though it takes a lot of yelling to do so.

<strong>Neshtek</strong> is a weird cat pigeon who eats fries and has a lot of drip.

<strong>Venus</strong> is an unoriginal space-themed character with some bad graphics.

<strong>Agar.io</strong> is an edgy guy who loves to wear glasses and a big bow.

<strong>Apple</strong> is the smart guy of the crew and wonders what is happening to United 93 right now while he is the one who is being the idiot.

<strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> is a nice man who loves to support others, especially Kazakhstan.</div>
