  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the tracklist for the Billie Eilish x Cults collab album, assuming a dark, indie-pop vibe with surprising twists, based on the provided artists and writer/producer:

<strong>Title: "Shadow Bloom"</strong>

1.  <strong>"Nightshades"</strong> (2:51) - Billie Eilish &amp; Cults - Opens with a haunting, ethereal soundscape. Focuses on insomnia and paranoia.
2.  <strong>"Static Echo"</strong> (3:38) - Billie Eilish &amp; Cults - Synth-heavy track, tackling feelings of isolation in modern society. Heavy bassline.
3.  <strong>"Obsidian Dreams"</strong> (Feat. Yma Sumac) (4:12) - Billie Eilish, Cults, Yma Sumac - Begins with Sumac's otherworldly vocals, then drops into a dark electronic beat. Focus on hidden power within dreams.
4.  <strong>"Concrete Skies"</strong> (3:05) - Billie Eilish &amp; Cults - Slower, melodic track about the feeling of being trapped in a big city, melancholic.
5.  <strong>"Fever Mind"</strong> (Feat. Rag'n'Bone Man) (3:58) - Billie Eilish, Cults, Rag'n'Bone Man - Gritty, blues-influenced track with a pounding beat. Rag'n'Bone Man's vocals provide a soulful contrast to Billie's whispery style. Deals with obsession.
6.  <strong>"Neon Graveyard"</strong> (2:47) - Cults - An instrumental interlude, reminiscent of a film score. Dark and atmospheric.
7.  <strong>"Ghostlight Parade"</strong> (Feat. Fall Out Boy) (3:45) - Billie Eilish, Cults, Fall Out Boy - High-energy track with punk influences. Pete Wentz's lyrics add a touch of dark humor to the album. About trying to find yourself in a dark and toxic world.
8.  <strong>"Velvet Chains"</strong> (3:22) - Billie Eilish &amp; Cults - Dark and groovy, with a nod to 70s psychedelia. Focuses on escapism.
9.  <strong>"Fractured Images"</strong> (Feat. Eurythmics) (4:01) - Billie Eilish, Cults, Eurythmics - Synth-pop track with an 80s flair. Annie Lennox's unmistakable vocals elevate the song. Theme of shattered perceptions.
10. <strong>"Moonlit Dystopia"</strong> (3:15) - Billie Eilish &amp; Cults - Uptempo, danceable track with a darker edge. About the contrast between beauty and decay.
11. <strong>"Synthetic Heart"</strong> (Feat. Lil Nas X) (3:52) - Billie Eilish, Cults, Lil Nas X - Trap-influenced track that blends Lil Nas X's playful energy with the album's darker themes. The song is about feeling emotionless.
12. <strong>"Shadow Bloom"</strong> (4:29) - Billie Eilish &amp; Cults - The album's title track, serving as a grand finale. Combines elements from all the previous songs, creating a complex and emotional soundscape. The Wailers bring a haunting reggae melody to the end.</div>
