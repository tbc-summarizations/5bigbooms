  <h1>Description for pede_bird.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on this alternative Ronaldo career, rated out of 10:

<strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>

<strong>Here's why:</strong>

•   <strong>Lack of International Success:</strong> A Ronaldo with ZERO international trophies is borderline blasphemous. He's Portuguese, for Christ's sake! The fact that he played 245 games with 102 goals and couldn't snag <em>anything</em> with Portugal is a massive failure. This single factor knocks the rating way down. No Euros, no World Cups, no Nations Leagues... unforgivable.

•   <strong>Mid-Tier European Clubs:</strong> While starting at Santa Clara is fine, the career trajectory is weird. Rijeka, Club Brugge, Lens, Fiorentina, Aston Villa... these aren't clubs where a player of Ronaldo's potential should be spending his prime years. He's wasting his potential in these teams. He needed to force a move to a top team in the late 2020s/early 2030s.

•   <strong>Late Career Move to Obscurity:</strong> Al-Duhail in Qatar at 39 is understandable for the money, but Sloboda Tuzla in Bosnia to finish his career? It's like he was intentionally trying to fade into obscurity. No offense to Bosnian football, but Ronaldo at 42 should be playing at a higher level, even if it's just in a less competitive league.

•   <strong>Underwhelming Stats for Ronaldo:</strong> 714 club goals is a good number, but for a player of Ronaldo's supposed caliber, it's far below what he should achieve. It's criminal for him to only have 132 club assists. Same with the international level, 102 goals aren't enough for how good he is supposed to be. He should be averaging closer to a goal a game, even in international soccer.

•   <strong>Inconsistent Trophy Haul:</strong> Winning a Europa League and a Super Cup with Chelsea is decent, but nothing exceptional. The Qatari and Bosnian trophies are basically stat-padding. They don't carry the same weight as Champions League titles or major European league titles.

•   <strong>The Good:</strong> Playing until 42 is respectable. The longevity is there. The fact he even got 102 international goals, even with no international silverware, isn't bad.

<strong>In conclusion:</strong>

This alternative career is a massive underachievement for a player supposedly on the level of Ronaldo. He wasted his potential at mid-tier clubs, achieved virtually nothing internationally, and ended his career in relative obscurity. The individual stats are decent, but ultimately, trophies and recognition are what define a legend, and this version of Ronaldo falls far short. It's basically a "what if Ronaldo was incredibly mediocre" scenario.</div>
