  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a breakdown of those European national football team logos, rated out of 10 with no holds barred:

<strong>Denmark (DBU): 6/10</strong>

This logo is boring as hell. It's a basic circle with the name and founding year, and a DBU slapped in the middle. There's zero imagination here. The red and white color scheme is okay, but the overall design is just uninspired and lazy. They need to fire their design team immediately.

<strong>Austria (ÖFB): 8/10</strong>

Now this is much better! The black eagle with the Austrian flag shield is classic and powerful. The font is clean, and the overall design has a strong, traditional feel. The football at the bottom is a nice touch. It's a solid representation of Austrian pride.

<strong>Ukraine: 7/10</strong>

I appreciate the attempt to incorporate the Tryzub (the Ukrainian coat of arms) into the logo. The blue and yellow colors are great, and it’s a recognizable symbol. However, the execution is a bit clunky. It could be more streamlined and modern. The football in the middle is unnecessary.

<strong>Turkey: 5/10</strong>

This is another fairly basic design. The crescent and star are obvious symbols of Turkey, and the red and white color scheme is fitting. But it’s just not very exciting. It's something a high school student could whip up in 5 minutes. They need to put some actual thought into it.

<strong>Sweden: 9/10</strong>

This is a fantastic logo! The yellow cross on a blue background is instantly recognizable as the Swedish flag. The font and the outline is simple and iconic. It represents the country's heritage. I can't find any faults with this logo at all.

<strong>Wales: 10/10</strong>

Now this is a logo that demands respect. The Red Dragon is fierce, and dynamic. I admire it so much, it's powerful! It really represents Wales and their passion. The tail's end in a shape of a heart is a fantastic touch and an indication of a deep passion for football. It is a really great logo!

<strong>Serbia: 8/10</strong>

This logo has a strong historical feel. The double-headed eagle is a symbol of Serbian pride. The Serbian flag is great. However the font could be improved as it looks very generic.

<strong>Poland: 4/10</strong>

This logo is hideous. It's a distorted, mess. It looks like an abstract art project gone wrong. It completely fails to capture the spirit of Poland or its football. They should scrap this and start over with something that has some semblance of style.

<strong>Russia: 2/10</strong>

I find this logo to be tasteless. It uses the colours of Russian flag and attempts to incorporate a football and an eagle with two heads, but it ends up looking cheap. It also doesn't give a feeling of football spirit.

<strong>Hungary: 6/10</strong>

This logo is just a mess. The Hungarian flag is badly shown. The football is ugly. The font is generic. This logo is a disaster.</div>
