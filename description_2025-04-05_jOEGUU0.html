  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the definitive ranking, from the utter garbage to the undeniable king:

13.  <strong>United Airlines Flight 93:</strong>  Bringing up a plane tragedy just ain't funny, and using it for some dumb joke is just straight-up tasteless. Fuck this plane character.
14.  <strong>PLEASUN_BANHENRY:</strong>  He is so full of himself. The whole "I'm so handsome" schtick is pathetic, and the Kazakhstan flag on his costume doesn't make any sense. 
15.  <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> The only great country in the world, according to him? Total nationalistic douchebag.
16.  <strong>Ap—Äle:</strong> Pretending to be an expert on everything while being ignorant as fuck. I don't think he even has an original personality of their own, so it's a skip. 
17.  <strong>Meethexep:</strong> A cat who only cares about math is the most uninteresting thing I have ever seen in my life.
18. <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy:</strong> Oh, how original: put him to your object show just because his country is in a war. I don't even like him that much as a politician.
19.   <strong>Dekoder:</strong>  Annoying as fuck, always complaining about everything, like an ugly child screaming at a toy store, and always so worried.
20.  <strong>Uami Bosim:</strong> Trying too hard to be quirky with the triangle look. He's clearly lost and can't even keep the name of his own show straight.
21.  <strong>Stickman:</strong> Bland and forgettable. Looks like a knock-off from some other show, and has a low creativity.
22.  <strong>Agar.io:</strong> He really thought to pull off being an "OG" and failed miserably.
23.  <strong>Emoji:</strong> A copy-cat and his idea as the first challenge was just bad, it would be funny on the show but not as a challenge.

Top Tier:

24.  <strong>Neshtek:</strong> Alright, a rich pigeon that doesn't give a fuck? I respect that shit. That "It's Poupou" song? Fucking iconic. Deserves to sit on the throne of object shows, or at least a pile of fries.
25.   <strong>Venus:</strong>  Calling everyone "newbies" and owning the fact he's a total asshole? I can get behind that.  And the guy pulls it off with a bit of style. He's the OG, and acts like it.</div>
